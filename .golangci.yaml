# Options for analysis running.
run:
  # Timeout for analysis, e.g. 30s, 5m.
  # If the value is lower or equal to 0, the timeout is disabled.
  # Default: 1m

  # If set, we pass it to "go list -mod={option}". From "go help modules":
  # If invoked with -mod=readonly, the go command is disallowed from the implicit
  # automatic updating of go.mod described above. Instead, it fails when any changes
  # to go.mod are needed. This setting is most useful to check that go.mod does
  # not need updates, such as in a continuous integration and testing system.
  # If invoked with -mod=vendor, the go command assumes that the vendor
  # directory holds the correct copies of dependencies and ignores
  # the dependency descriptions in go.mod.

  # Define the Go version limit.
  # Mainly related to generics support since go1.18.
  # Default: use Go version from the go.mod file, fallback on the env var `GOVERSION`, fallback on 1.17
  # go: "1.22"
  # Number of operating system threads (`GOMAXPROCS`) that can execute golangci-lint simultaneously.
